                    <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Starting my journey as a developer was both exciting and challenging. I still remember the day I landed my first role, stepping into a world where my coding skills were about to be tested in real-world scenarios. The company was a medium-sized tech firm focused on creating innovative web applications. My primary responsibilities revolved around front-end development, ensuring websites were not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. It was a thrilling opportunity to apply what I had learned and to grow in a professional environment.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning, there was a lot to take in. Adjusting to a fast-paced work culture, collaborating with a team of experienced developers, and meeting project deadlines pushed me out of my comfort zone. However, these challenges fueled my motivation. My first project involved developing a responsive user interface for an e-commerce website. Debugging errors and refining the design taught me the importance of attention to detail. With guidance from my mentors, I quickly adapted to the team’s workflow and became confident in using tools like Git and frameworks like Django.</p>
